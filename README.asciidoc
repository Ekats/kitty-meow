= kitty-meow 😺 - kitty fork with persistent selection

[NOTE]
====
**This is a fork of https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty[kitty]** with a fix for persistent text selection.

*The Problem:* In upstream kitty, text selection gets cleared when new terminal output arrives. This makes it impossible to copy text from log tails, build output, or any continuously updating terminal.

*The Fix:* This fork preserves selections when new output arrives, matching the behavior of xterm.js (VSCode/VSCodium terminal). Selections are only cleared when they scroll completely out of the history buffer.

See https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/148[Issue #148] for the original feature request.

== Mouse-Friendly Split Controls

kitty-meow adds intuitive mouse controls for managing split windows:

* **Close Button**: Each split window shows an X button in the top-right corner (when multiple splits exist)
* **Drag-to-Resize**: Hover over borders between splits to get a resize cursor, then drag to resize

Both features can be toggled in your config:

[source,conf]
----
show_window_close_button yes   # Show/hide close button on splits
enable_border_drag_resize yes  # Enable/disable drag-to-resize
----
