= kitty-meow 😺 - kitty fork with persistent selection

[NOTE]
====
**This is a fork of https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty[kitty]** with additional features:

*Persistent Selection:* Text selection is preserved when new terminal output arrives, matching xterm.js behavior. Selections only clear when scrolled out of history. See https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/148[Issue #148].

*Mouse-Friendly Splits:* Close button on split windows (top-right X) and drag-to-resize borders. Configure with `show_window_close_button` and `enable_border_drag_resize`.
